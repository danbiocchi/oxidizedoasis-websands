3. **Database Maintenance**
   ```sql
   -- Example database maintenance script
   
   -- Analyze tables for query optimization
   ANALYZE VERBOSE;
   
   -- Vacuum tables to reclaim space and update statistics
   VACUUM ANALYZE users;
   VACUUM ANALYZE active_tokens;
   VACUUM ANALYZE profile_settings;
   VACUUM ANALYZE security_events;
   
   -- Reindex tables to improve index performance
   REINDEX TABLE users;
   REINDEX TABLE active_tokens;
   REINDEX TABLE profile_settings;
   REINDEX TABLE security_events;
   
   -- Check for bloated tables
   SELECT schemaname, relname, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup, 
          (n_dead_tup::float / (n_live_tup + n_dead_tup) * 100)::int AS dead_percentage
   FROM pg_stat_user_tables
   WHERE n_dead_tup > 0
   ORDER BY dead_percentage DESC;
   
   -- Check for unused indexes
   SELECT s.schemaname, s.relname, s.indexrelname, s.idx_scan, 
          pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(i.indexrelid)) AS index_size
   FROM pg_stat_user_indexes s
   JOIN pg_index i ON s.indexrelid = i.indexrelid
   WHERE s.idx_scan = 0 AND NOT i.indisprimary
   ORDER BY pg_relation_size(i.indexrelid) DESC;
   ```

4. **Dependency Updates**
   ```bash
   # Example dependency update script
   
   # Update Rust dependencies
   echo "Checking for outdated dependencies..."
   cargo outdated
   
   echo "Updating dependencies..."
   cargo update
   
   # Run tests to verify updates
   echo "Running tests..."
   cargo test
   
   # If tests pass, commit changes
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
     echo "Tests passed, committing updates..."
     git add Cargo.lock
     git commit -m "Update dependencies"
     echo "Dependencies updated successfully!"
   else
     echo "Tests failed, reverting updates..."
     git checkout -- Cargo.lock
     echo "Dependency update failed!"
   fi
   ```

   | P4 - Low | Minor issues with minimal impact | < 8 hours | < 72 hours | UI glitches, non-critical warnings |

3. **Emergency Rollback Procedure**
   ```bash
   # Example emergency rollback script
   
   # Set variables
   ENVIRONMENT=$1
   VERSION=$2
   ROLLBACK_VERSION=$3
   
   # Check inputs
   if [ -z "$ENVIRONMENT" ] || [ -z "$VERSION" ] || [ -z "$ROLLBACK_VERSION" ]; then
     echo "Usage: $0 <environment> <current_version> <rollback_version>"
     exit 1
   fi
   
   echo "EMERGENCY ROLLBACK: Rolling back $ENVIRONMENT from $VERSION to $ROLLBACK_VERSION"
   
   # Notify team
   ./notify_team.sh "EMERGENCY ROLLBACK INITIATED: $ENVIRONMENT from $VERSION to $ROLLBACK_VERSION"
   
   # Update Kubernetes deployments
   echo "Updating deployments to rollback version..."
   kubectl set image deployment/api-service api-service=oxidizedoasis/api-service:$ROLLBACK_VERSION -n oxidizedoasis
   kubectl set image deployment/frontend frontend=oxidizedoasis/frontend:$ROLLBACK_VERSION -n oxidizedoasis
   
   # Wait for rollout to complete
   echo "Waiting for rollout to complete..."
   kubectl rollout status deployment/api-service -n oxidizedoasis
   kubectl rollout status deployment/frontend -n oxidizedoasis
   
   # Verify service health
   echo "Verifying service health..."
   ./verify_health.sh $ENVIRONMENT
   
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
     echo "Rollback successful!"
     ./notify_team.sh "EMERGENCY ROLLBACK COMPLETED: $ENVIRONMENT successfully rolled back to $ROLLBACK_VERSION"
   else
     echo "Rollback verification failed! Manual intervention required!"
     ./notify_team.sh "EMERGENCY ROLLBACK FAILED: $ENVIRONMENT rollback to $ROLLBACK_VERSION failed verification. MANUAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED!"
   fi
   ```

5. **Post-Incident Analysis**
   ```markdown
   # Post-Incident Analysis Report
   
   ## Incident Overview
   - **Incident ID**: INC-2025-03-21-001
   - **Severity**: P1 - Critical
   - **Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes (14:30 - 16:45 UTC)
   - **Affected Services**: Authentication API, User Management
   
   ## Timeline
   - **14:25 UTC**: Monitoring alert triggered for high database latency
   - **14:30 UTC**: Authentication failures reported by users
   - **14:35 UTC**: Incident declared, response team assembled
   - **14:45 UTC**: Initial diagnosis identified database connection pool exhaustion
   - **15:00 UTC**: Temporary mitigation applied by increasing connection pool size
   - **15:30 UTC**: Root cause identified as connection leak in user service
   - **16:00 UTC**: Hotfix deployed to fix connection leak
   - **16:30 UTC**: Services verified as operational
   - **16:45 UTC**: Incident closed
   
   ## Root Cause
   A connection leak in the user service was not properly releasing database connections back to the pool after handling requests. This was introduced in version 1.5.2 deployed on 2025-03-20.
   
   ## Resolution
   A hotfix (version 1.5.3) was deployed that properly closes database connections in all error paths. Additionally, connection pool monitoring was enhanced to provide earlier warnings of pool exhaustion.
   
   ## Impact
   - Approximately 3,500 users were unable to log in during the incident
   - 250 new user registrations were prevented
   - No data loss occurred
   
   ## Lessons Learned
   1. Connection pool metrics were not prominently displayed in monitoring dashboards
   2. The connection leak was not caught in testing because tests use a separate connection pool
   3. The deployment process did not include specific checks for connection usage
   
   ## Action Items
   1. Add connection pool metrics to primary monitoring dashboard (Assigned: DevOps Team, Due: 2025-03-23)
   2. Update test environment to mirror production connection pool configuration (Assigned: QA Team, Due: 2025-03-28)
   3. Add connection leak detection to CI pipeline (Assigned: Development Team, Due: 2025-04-05)
   4. Review all database interaction code for similar issues (Assigned: Development Team, Due: 2025-04-10)
   5. Update incident response playbook with database connection troubleshooting steps (Assigned: Operations Team, Due: 2025-03-25)
   ```

   ```

2. **Log Levels and Usage**

   | Log Level | Purpose | Example Usage | Retention |
   |-----------|---------|---------------|-----------|
   | ERROR | Critical failures requiring immediate attention | System crashes, data corruption, security breaches | 90 days |
   | WARN | Potential issues that don't prevent operation | Connection retries, performance degradation, deprecated feature usage | 60 days |
   | INFO | Normal operational events | User logins, API requests, system startup/shutdown | 30 days |
   | DEBUG | Detailed information for troubleshooting | Function entry/exit, variable values, state transitions | 7 days |
   | TRACE | Extremely detailed diagnostic information | SQL queries, HTTP requests/responses, function parameters | 3 days |

3. **Structured Logging Format**
   ```json
   // Example structured log format
   {
     "timestamp": "2025-03-21T14:32:15.123Z",
     "level": "INFO",
     "service": "api-service",
     "instance": "api-service-5d8f7c9b68-xvz2p",
     "trace_id": "4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736",
     "span_id": "0be7ca9d4c524cba",
     "user_id": "e89b12d3-a456-426614174000",
     "request_id": "abcdef123456",
     "method": "POST",
     "path": "/api/v1/auth/login",
     "status_code": 200,
     "duration_ms": 45,
     "message": "User login successful",
     "context": {
       "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
       "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36",
       "referrer": "https://app.oxidizedoasis.com/login"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Log Collection Configuration**
   ```yaml
   # Example Fluentd configuration
   <source>
     @type tail
     path /var/log/containers/api-service-*.log
     pos_file /var/log/fluentd-api-service.pos
     tag kubernetes.api-service
     read_from_head true
     <parse>
       @type json
       time_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%NZ
     </parse>
   </source>
   
   <filter kubernetes.api-service>
     @type parser
     key_name log
     <parse>
       @type json
       time_format %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%NZ
     </parse>
     reserve_data true
     remove_key_name_field true
   </filter>
   
   <filter kubernetes.api-service>
     @type record_transformer
     <record>
       service_name ${record["kubernetes"]["labels"]["app"]}
       namespace ${record["kubernetes"]["namespace_name"]}
       pod_name ${record["kubernetes"]["pod_name"]}
       container_name ${record["kubernetes"]["container_name"]}
     </record>
   </filter>
   
   <match kubernetes.api-service>
     @type elasticsearch
     host elasticsearch
     port 9200
     logstash_format true
     logstash_prefix api-service
     include_tag_key true
     type_name fluentd
     tag_key @log_name
     flush_interval 5s
   </match>
   ```

5. **Log Analysis Techniques**
   - **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring patterns in logs
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Finding unusual patterns or deviations
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Connecting related events across services
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Tracing issues to their source
   - **Performance Analysis**: Identifying bottlenecks and slow operations
   - **Security Analysis**: Detecting suspicious activities and potential breaches
   - **User Behavior Analysis**: Understanding user interactions and issues

6. **Log Retention Policy**
   ```markdown
   # Log Retention Policy
   
   ## Retention Periods
   - ERROR logs: 90 days
   - WARN logs: 60 days
   - INFO logs: 30 days
   - DEBUG logs: 7 days
   - TRACE logs: 3 days
   
   ## Long-term Archiving
   - Security audit logs: 1 year
   - Authentication logs: 1 year
   - Administrative action logs: 1 year
   - Payment transaction logs: 7 years
   
   ## Compliance Requirements
   - All logs containing personal data must be anonymized after the retention period
   - Logs must be stored in a secure, encrypted format
   - Access to logs must be restricted and audited
   - Log deletion must be documented and verifiable
   
   ## Archiving Process
   1. Daily: Logs are collected and stored in Elasticsearch
   2. Weekly: Logs exceeding 7 days are compressed and moved to cold storage
   3. Monthly: Logs exceeding 30 days are archived to long-term storage
   4. Quarterly: Archived logs are verified for integrity
   5. Annually: Logs exceeding retention periods are securely deleted
