            HttpResponse::BadRequest().json(errors.into_iter().map(|e| e.to_string()).collect::<Vec<String>>())
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.2 User Authentication

The system implements secure authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Key aspects:
- Users authenticate with their username and password.
- Passwords are verified against the stored bcrypt hash.
- Upon successful authentication, a JWT is issued for subsequent requests.
- JWTs have an expiration time to enhance security.

Implementation (excerpt from `src/handlers/user.rs`):

```rust
pub async fn login_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, user: web::Json<LoginInput>) -> impl Responder {
    let validated_user = match validate_and_sanitize_login_input(user.into_inner()) {
        Ok(user) => user,
        Err(errors) => return HttpResponse::BadRequest().json(errors.into_iter().map(|e| e.to_string()).collect::<Vec<String>>()),
    };

    // User retrieval from database and password verification
    // ...

    match verify(&validated_user.password, &db_user.password_hash) {
        Ok(true) => {
            let jwt_secret = std::env::var("JWT_SECRET").expect("JWT_SECRET must be set");
            match auth::create_jwt(db_user.id, &jwt_secret) {
                Ok(token) => {
                    let user_response: UserResponse = db_user.into();

                        "message": "Login successful",
                        "token": token,
                        "user": user_response
                    }))
                },
                Err(e) => {
                    error!("Failed to create JWT: {:?}", e);
                    HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Error during login")
                }
            }
        },
        // Error handling
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Profile Management

Authenticated users are provided with the ability to view and update their profile information.

Key aspects:
- Users can retrieve their profile details.
- Users can update their username, email, and password.
- Profile updates undergo validation before being saved to the database.

Implementation (excerpt from `src/handlers/user.rs`):

```rust
#[put("/users/{id}")]
pub async fn update_user(
    pool: web::Data<PgPool>,
    id: web::Path<Uuid>,
    user_input: web::Json<UserInput>,
    auth: BearerAuth,
) -> impl Responder {
    // Authentication and authorization checks
    // ...

    let validated_user = match validate_and_sanitize_user_input(user_input.into_inner()) {
        Ok(user) => user,
        Err(errors) => return HttpResponse::BadRequest().json(errors.into_iter().map(|e| e.to_string()).collect::<Vec<String>>()),
    };

    // User update in database
    // ...
}
```

### 3.2 Authentication and Authorization

The system implements a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure secure access to resources.

#### 3.2.1 JWT-based Authentication

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized for stateless authentication.

Key aspects:
- JWTs are issued upon successful login.
- JWTs contain the user's ID and expiration time.
- All protected routes require a valid JWT for access.

Implementation (excerpt from `src/auth.rs`):

```rust
pub fn create_jwt(user_id: Uuid, secret: &str) -> Result<String, jsonwebtoken::errors::Error> {
    let expiration = Utc::now()
        .checked_add_signed(Duration::hours(24))
        .expect("valid timestamp")
        .timestamp();

    let claims = Claims {
        sub: user_id,
        exp: expiration,
        iat: Utc::now().timestamp(),
    };

    encode(&Header::default(), &claims, &EncodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()))
}
```

#### 3.2.2 Role-based Authorization

Role-based access control is implemented for different user types.

Key aspects:
- Users are assigned different roles (e.g., regular user, admin).
- Certain routes and actions are restricted based on user roles.

Implementation (excerpt from `src/handlers/admin.rs`):

```rust
pub async fn admin_validator(req: ServiceRequest, credentials: BearerAuth) -> Result<ServiceRequest, (Error, ServiceRequest)> {
    // JWT validation
    // ...

    match user {
        Ok(Some(user)) if user.role == "admin" => {
            info!("Admin access granted for user: {}", claims.sub);
            Ok(req)
        },
        _ => {
            error!("Admin access denied for user: {}", claims.sub);
            Err((ErrorUnauthorized("Admin access required"), req))
        }
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Security Features

OxidizedOasis-WebSands implements several security features to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### 3.3.1 Password Hashing

All user passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt algorithm prior to storage.

Implementation (excerpt from `src/handlers/user.rs`):

```rust
let password_hash = match hash(&password, DEFAULT_COST) {
    Ok(hash) => hash,
    Err(e) => {
        error!("Failed to hash password: {:?}", e);
        return HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("Failed to create user");
    }
};
```

#### 3.3.2 Input Validation and Sanitization

Thorough input validation and sanitization are implemented to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.

Implementation (excerpt from `src/validation.rs`):

```rust
pub fn validate_and_sanitize_user_input(input: UserInput) -> Result<UserInput, Vec<ValidationError>> {
    // Validation logic
    // ...

    if errors.is_empty() {
        Ok(UserInput {
            username: sanitize_input(&input.username),
            email: input.email.map(|e| sanitize_input(&e)),
            password: input.password,  // Passwords are not sanitized
        })
    } else {
        Err(errors)
    }
}
```

#### 3.3.3 CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured to control which domains can access the API.

Implementation (excerpt from `src/main.rs`):

```rust
let cors = Cors::default()
    .allowed_origin(&allowed_origin)
    .allowed_methods(vec!["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"])
    .allowed_headers(vec![http::header::AUTHORIZATION, http::header::ACCEPT, http::header::CONTENT_TYPE])
    .max_age(3600);

## 4. Data Model

The OxidizedOasis-WebSands system employs a data model that efficiently supports user management and authentication functionalities. This section delineates the database schema, relationships between entities, and the implementation of the data access layer.

### 4.1 Database Schema

PostgreSQL has been selected as the database management system for OxidizedOasis-WebSands. The schema consists of the following primary tables:

#### 4.1.1 Users Table

The `users` table is designed to store essential information about registered users.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    is_email_verified BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    verification_token VARCHAR(32),
    verification_token_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    role VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user'
);

CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

Field descriptions:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each user (UUID).
- `username`: User's chosen username (unique).
- `email`: User's email address (optional, unique if provided).
- `password_hash`: Bcrypt hash of the user's password.
- `is_email_verified`: Boolean flag indicating email verification status.
- `verification_token`: Token sent to the user for email verification.
- `verification_token_expires_at`: Expiration timestamp for the verification token.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of account creation.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of the last account update.
- `role`: User's role in the system (e.g., 'user', 'admin').

#### 4.1.2 Sessions Table

The `sessions` table is designed to track active user sessions. While not currently implemented, it is included in the schema for future enhancements to support features such as session management and forced logout.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_user_id ON sessions(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_sessions_token ON sessions(token);
```

Field descriptions:
- `id`: Unique identifier for each session (UUID).
- `user_id`: ID of the user to whom the session belongs.
- `token`: JWT token associated with the session.
- `expires_at`: Expiration timestamp of the session.
- `created_at`: Timestamp of session creation.

### 4.2 Entity Relationships

The relationships between entities in the OxidizedOasis-WebSands database are structured as follows:

1. **Users to Sessions** (1:N)
   - One user can have multiple active sessions.
   - Each session belongs to exactly one user.
   - This relationship is established by the `user_id` foreign key in the `sessions` table.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USERS ||--o{ SESSIONS : has
    USERS {
        UUID id
        VARCHAR username
        VARCHAR email
        VARCHAR password_hash
        BOOLEAN is_email_verified
        VARCHAR verification_token
        TIMESTAMP verification_token_expires_at
        TIMESTAMP created_at
        TIMESTAMP updated_at
        VARCHAR role
    }
    SESSIONS {
        UUID id
        UUID user_id
        VARCHAR token
        TIMESTAMP expires_at
        TIMESTAMP created_at
    }
```

### 4.3 Data Access Layer

The data access layer in OxidizedOasis-WebSands is implemented using SQLx, which provides type-safe database interactions. The following sections outline the structure of the data access layer:

#### 4.3.1 User Model

The User model represents the structure of user data in the application. It is defined in `src/models/user.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize, FromRow)]
pub struct User {
    pub id: Uuid,
    pub username: String,
    pub email: Option<String>,
    pub password_hash: String,
    pub is_email_verified: bool,
    pub verification_token: Option<String>,
    pub verification_token_expires_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub role: String,
}
```

#### 4.3.2 Database Queries

Database queries are performed using SQLx macros, which provide compile-time checking of SQL statements. An example of a query to create a new user (from `src/handlers/user.rs`) is presented below:

```rust
let result = sqlx::query_as!(
    User,
    r#"
    INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, password_hash, is_email_verified, verification_token, verification_token_expires_at, created_at, updated_at, role)
    VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6, $7, $8, $9, $10)
    RETURNING *
    "#,
    Uuid::new_v4(),
    validated_user.username,
    validated_user.email,
    password_hash,
    false,
    verification_token,
    verification_token_expires_at,
    now,
    now,
    "user" // Default role set to "user"
)
.fetch_one(pool.get_ref())
.await;
```

#### 4.3.3 Data Validation and Sanitization

Input data undergoes validation and sanitization before being used in database operations. This process is handled by functions in the `src/validation.rs` file:

```rust
pub fn validate_and_sanitize_user_input(input: UserInput) -> Result<UserInput, Vec<ValidationError>> {
    // Validation logic
    // ...

    if errors.is_empty() {
        Ok(UserInput {
            username: sanitize_input(&input.username),
            email: input.email.map(|e| sanitize_input(&e)),
            password: input.password,  // Passwords are not sanitized
        })
    } else {
        Err(errors)
    }
}
```

This data model design ensures data integrity, enforces relationships between entities, and provides a secure and efficient method for interacting with the database. The use of SQLx for database operations allows for type-safe queries and aids in preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The implementation of this data model and access layer establishes a solid foundation for OxidizedOasis-WebSands that supports current features and allows for future scalability and feature additions.

## 6. Non-functional Requirements

OxidizedOasis-WebSands is designed to meet several key non-functional requirements to ensure the system's overall quality, effectiveness, and robustness. This section outlines these requirements, focusing on performance, security, reliability, availability, and scalability.

### 6.1 Performance Requirements

OxidizedOasis-WebSands is engineered to provide high performance and responsiveness to user requests.

#### 6.1.1 Response Time

- API responses should be returned within 100ms for 95% of requests under normal load.
- The system should handle at least 1000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.

To achieve these performance goals, the following measures have been implemented:

- Efficient database queries using SQLx
- Asynchronous request handling with Actix-web
- Connection pooling for database operations

#### 6.1.2 Rate Limiting

To prevent abuse and ensure fair usage, rate limiting is implemented using the `actix-governor` crate. This is configured in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
let governor_conf = GovernorConfigBuilder::default()
    .per_second(2) // Allow 2 requests per second
    .burst_size(5) // Allow a burst of 5 requests
    .finish()
    .unwrap();

// ... 

.service(
    web::scope("/users")
        .wrap(Governor::new(&governor_conf))
        // ... route definitions
)
```

#### 6.1.3 Database Performance

- Database queries are optimized to execute within 50ms for 95% of queries.
- Indexes are created on frequently queried fields to improve lookup performance:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

### 6.2 Security Requirements

Security is a top priority for OxidizedOasis-WebSands. Several measures have been implemented to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### 6.2.1 Authentication

- All passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage.
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for stateless authentication.
- JWTs have an expiration time of 24 hours to limit the window of potential misuse.

Implementation in `src/auth.rs`:

```rust
pub fn create_jwt(user_id: Uuid, secret: &str) -> Result<String, jsonwebtoken::errors::Error> {
    let expiration = Utc::now()
        .checked_add_signed(Duration::hours(24))
        .expect("valid timestamp")
        .timestamp();

    let claims = Claims {
        sub: user_id,
        exp: expiration,
        iat: Utc::now().timestamp(),
    };

    encode(&Header::default(), &claims, &EncodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()))
}
```

#### 6.2.2 Authorization

- Role-based access control is implemented to restrict access to sensitive operations.
- Admin routes are protected by a separate middleware that checks for admin privileges.

Example from `src/handlers/admin.rs`:

```rust
pub async fn admin_validator(req: ServiceRequest, credentials: BearerAuth) -> Result<ServiceRequest, (Error, ServiceRequest)> {
    // ... JWT validation ...
    match user {
        Ok(Some(user)) if user.role == "admin" => {
            info!("Admin access granted for user: {}", claims.sub);
            Ok(req)
        },
        _ => {
            error!("Admin access denied for user: {}", claims.sub);
            Err((ErrorUnauthorized("Admin access required"), req))
        }
    }
}
```

#### 6.2.3 Data Protection

- All sensitive data transmissions occur over HTTPS.
- Input validation and sanitization are performed on all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- CORS is configured to restrict which domains can access the API.

CORS configuration in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
let cors = Cors::default()
    .allowed_origin(&allowed_origin)
    .allowed_methods(vec!["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"])
    .allowed_headers(vec![http::header::AUTHORIZATION, http::header::ACCEPT, http::header::CONTENT_TYPE])
    .max_age(3600);
```

### 6.3 Reliability and Availability

OxidizedOasis-WebSands is designed to be a reliable and highly available system.

#### 6.3.1 Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the application to gracefully handle and log errors.
- Custom error types and responses are used to provide meaningful feedback to clients.

#### 6.3.2 Logging

- The system uses the `log` and `env_logger` crates for application logging.
- Different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) are used appropriately to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

Logging configuration in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
env_logger::Builder::from_env(Env::default().default_filter_or("debug")).init();
```

#### 6.3.3 Availability Target

- The database connection pool is configured to efficiently handle multiple concurrent connections:

```rust
let pool = PgPoolOptions::new()
    .max_connections(5)
    .connect(&database_url)
    .await
    .expect("Failed to create database connection pool");
```

#### 6.4.2 Database Scalability

- The use of UUID for primary keys allows for distributed ID generation, facilitating potential future sharding.
- Indexes are used judiciously to balance query performance with write performance as the dataset grows.

#### 6.4.3 Containerization and Orchestration

- The application is containerized using Docker, allowing for consistent deployment across different environments.
- Kubernetes is used for orchestration, enabling easy scaling and management of the application.

These non-functional requirements ensure that OxidizedOasis-WebSands not only meets its functional goals but also provides a secure, performant, and scalable platform for user management and authentication. Regular monitoring and optimization will be necessary to maintain these standards as the system grows and evolves.

#### 7.3.3 Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming patterns are used throughout the application to improve performance and resource utilization:
- The `async`/`await` syntax is used for asynchronous operations
- Futures are composed using combinators where appropriate

#### 7.3.4 Security Practices

- All user inputs are validated and sanitized before use
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before storage
- JWT tokens are used for stateless authentication
- HTTPS is enforced in production environments

### 7.4 Error Handling and Logging

#### 7.4.1 Logging

The `log` and `env_logger` crates are used for application logging:

```rust
use log::{debug, error, info, warn};

// In main.rs
env_logger::Builder::from_env(Env::default().default_filter_or("debug")).init();

// Usage in application code
info!("User created successfully");
error!("Failed to create user: {:?}", e);
```

#### 7.4.2 Error Propagation

Errors are propagated up the call stack using Rust's `?` operator, allowing for concise error handling:

```rust
pub async fn create_user(pool: web::Data<PgPool>, user: web::Json<UserInput>) -> Result<HttpResponse, Error> {
    let validated_user = validate_and_sanitize_user_input(user.into_inner())?;
    let password_hash = hash_password(&validated_user.password)?;
    let user = insert_user_into_db(pool, validated_user, password_hash).await?;
    Ok(HttpResponse::Created().json(user))
}
```

These implementation details provide a solid foundation for OxidizedOasis-WebSands, leveraging Rust's strengths in performance and safety while following industry best practices for web application development. The chosen technologies and practices contribute to a robust, maintainable, and efficient system.

## 8. Testing

OxidizedOasis-WebSands adopts a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the reliability, correctness, and security of the system. This section outlines the approach, categories of tests, testing environment, and security testing procedures.

### 8.1 Test Approach

The testing approach for OxidizedOasis-WebSands includes:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Developers are encouraged to write tests before implementing features, ensuring that code is designed with testability in mind.

2. **Continuous Integration**: Tests are automatically run on every commit to the main branch, ensuring that new changes do not break existing functionality.

3. **Code Coverage**: A target of at least 80% code coverage is set for the project, with critical paths aiming for 100% coverage.

### 8.2 Test Categories

#### 8.2.1 Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components and functions in isolation. In Rust, unit tests are typically placed in the same file as the code they're testing, within a `tests` module.

Example of a unit test for the `create_jwt` function:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use chrono::Utc;

    #[test]
    fn test_create_jwt() {
        let user_id = Uuid::new_v4();
        let secret = "test_secret";
        let token = create_jwt(user_id, secret).unwrap();
        
        let validation = Validation::default();
        let token_data = decode::<Claims>(&token, &DecodingKey::from_secret(secret.as_ref()), &validation).unwrap();
        
        assert_eq!(token_data.claims.sub, user_id);
        assert!(token_data.claims.exp > Utc::now().timestamp());
    }
}
```

#### 8.2.2 Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between different components of the system. For OxidizedOasis-WebSands, this primarily involves testing the API endpoints.

Actix-web provides testing utilities that can be used to simulate HTTP requests without starting a server. These tests would be placed in a separate `tests` directory at the root of the project.

Example of an integration test for the user registration endpoint:

```rust
#[actix_rt::test]
async fn test_user_registration() {
    let mut app = test::init_service(
        App::new()
            .app_data(web::Data::new(get_test_db_pool().await))
            .service(web::scope("/users").route("/register", web::post().to(create_user)))
    ).await;

    let req = test::TestRequest::post()
        .uri("/users/register")
        .set_json(&json!({
            "username": "testuser",
            "email": "test@example.com",
            "password": "Password123!"
        }))
        .to_request();

    let resp = test::call_service(&mut app, req).await;
    assert_eq!(resp.status(), http::StatusCode::CREATED);

    let body: serde_json::Value = test::read_body_json(resp).await;
    assert_eq!(body["user"]["username"], "testuser");
    assert_eq!(body["user"]["email"], "test@example.com");
}
```

#### 8.2.3 Performance Tests

Performance tests ensure that the system meets its performance requirements under various conditions.

- **Load Testing**: Simulates multiple users accessing the system simultaneously to verify performance under expected load.
- **Stress Testing**: Pushes the system beyond its normal capacity to identify breaking points.

These tests can be implemented using tools like Apache JMeter or Gatling.

#### 8.2.4 Security Tests

Security testing is crucial for OxidizedOasis-WebSands to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

- **Penetration Testing**: Simulated attacks on the system to identify security weaknesses.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning of the codebase and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

### 8.3 Test Environment

The testing environment for OxidizedOasis-WebSands is designed to closely mimic the production environment while providing isolation for test execution.

Key aspects of the test environment:

1. **Isolated Database**: A separate PostgreSQL database is used for testing to avoid interfering with development or production data.

2. **Environment Variables**: Test-specific environment variables are used, stored in a `.env.test` file:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://testuser:testpass@localhost/test_oxidizedoasis
   JWT_SECRET=test_secret
   ```

3. **Mocked External Services**: External services, such as the email service, are mocked in the test environment to ensure consistent and predictable behavior.

### 8.4 Security Testing

Given the sensitive nature of user authentication and management, security testing is a critical aspect of the OxidizedOasis-WebSands testing strategy.

#### 8.4.1 Automated Security Scans

- **Dependency Checking**: Regular scans of project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using `cargo audit`.
- **Static Analysis**: Use of `clippy` with additional security lints to identify potential security issues in the codebase.

#### 8.4.2 Manual Security Reviews

- Regular code reviews with a focus on security implications of new features or changes.
- Periodic comprehensive security audits of the entire system.

#### 8.4.3 Specific Security Tests

1. **Authentication Tests**:
   - Verify that passwords are properly hashed and salted.
   - Ensure that authentication tokens (JWTs) are properly validated and cannot be tampered with.

2. **Authorization Tests**:
   - Verify that users can only access resources they are authorized for.
   - Ensure that admin-only routes are properly protected.

3. **Input Validation Tests**:
   - Test all input fields with various types of malformed input to ensure proper validation and sanitization.

4. **CORS Tests**:
   - Verify that CORS policies are correctly implemented and prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

Example of a security-focused test:

```rust
#[actix_rt::test]
async fn test_password_hashing() {
    let password = "SecurePassword123!";
    let hashed = hash_password(password).unwrap();
    
    // Verify that the hashed password is not the same as the original
    assert_ne!(password, hashed);
    
    // Verify that the hashed password can be verified
    assert!(verify_password(password, &hashed).unwrap());
    
    // Verify that an incorrect password fails verification
    assert!(!verify_password("WrongPassword", &hashed).unwrap());
}
```

By implementing this comprehensive testing strategy, OxidizedOasis-WebSands aims to maintain a high level of quality, reliability, and security throughout its development lifecycle. Regular execution of these tests, both automated and manual, helps to catch issues early and ensure the system remains robust as it evolves.
