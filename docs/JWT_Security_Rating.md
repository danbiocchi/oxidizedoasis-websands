## Conclusion

The JWT token refresh mechanism represents a significant security improvement over the previous implementation. With an overall rating of 8.5/10, it follows most industry best practices for secure token-based authentication. The implementation of a dual-token system with proper expiration, validation, and revocation capabilities provides a solid foundation for secure authentication.

Key areas for improvement include:
1. Enhancing frontend token storage security
2. Implementing refresh token rotation
3. Completing the token revocation system
4. Adding additional security claims

By addressing these recommendations, the security posture can be further strengthened to provide robust protection against common authentication vulnerabilities.
